<h1>The best movies according to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of the year</h2>
<hr /> 

<h3>Leave the world behind</h3>
<p>This was a good movie featuring Julia Roberts and <br /> the plot was eery and was intriguing from the begining </p>

<h3>Society of the snow</h3>
<p>This was a great remake of a tradgedy film and<br /> had edge of the seat and though provoking scenes</p>

<h3>All quiet on the western front</h3>
<p>One of the more horrifying war films of recent time that I have seen.</p>
